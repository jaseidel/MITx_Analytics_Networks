However, within a Cocitation network, the two papers would be highly connected, since many other papers cite both papers.

We might expect the growth of the network in the first three phases to be a result of the initial success of drug trafficing without any seizures, and the subsequent stabilization and slight decline of the network in phases 4 and 5 to be a result of the 1st seizure, which occured at phase 4. Following this seizure, we also note that trafficing began to reorient to cocaine import from Colombia, transiting through the United States, using a different network from the initial maruajana import from Morocco through Spain.  This shift in the network orientation should also adjust conclusions about centrality of nodes prior to phase 4 and after phase 4.\n"
